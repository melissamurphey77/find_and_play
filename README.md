# find_and_play
Find and Play will be a web app that would narrow parks by amenities including wheelchair accessible and sensory.

As a mom, I would like to be able to go to an app, select the type of park I'm looking for by amenities and go play! I can ask google for parks or ask where can I find a park that __, but the search is minimal because it may be picking up on keywords from the page where the park is listed that has nothing to do with what I'm looking for.

I am a mom who will think of doing something like going to the park at the spur of the moment. It may just so happen that we unexpectantly have an hour, etc. to go to the park and burn some energy. Also, if we have planned to go to the park, maybe what we want to do (play basketball, for example) isn't at the park closest to us.

Having a child with you that may have special needs can be frustrating if there aren't things accessible for those children also. How could someone find these types of amenities also?

Taking these things in consideration, someone could spend 15 minutes or more just trying to sift through site after site. It is very easy to go down a rabbit hole of searching. So much time is wasted it can get frustrating that can result in time lost or forgetting it all together.

This is how I thought of Find and Play.
